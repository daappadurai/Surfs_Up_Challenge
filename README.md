# **Surfs Up Challenge**

## **Overview:**

The goal of this analysis is to determine sustainability of opening a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu, Hawaii. As any business, itâ€™s important to determine if the business is seasonal or continuous business. While most people, plan vacations in the summer when temperatures are ideal, places like Hawaii, can attract people throughout the year because of its ideal island climate. Nevertheless, it is important to ensure that there is consistent sunny climate throughout the year. Therefore, for this analysis the temperatures for June and December are evaluated.

## **Comparing Mean temperatures for the months of June and December:**

Temperature data used for analysis spans from 2010 to 2016. About 1500-1700 individual data entries are used for analysis. A larger sample size produces reliable statistical outcomes. Therefore, the mean obtained can be expected to be very close to the mean of the temperature distribution for the months of June and December in Oahu, Hawaii. Based on the statistics it is obvious that there is no meaningful differences between the mean temperature in June (75 F) and December (71F). Since this mean is based on over a thousand entries, this mean value can be taken as a reliable estimate for the mean temperature of any June or dec month in Oahu. The conclusion is that there is steady sunny climate in Oahu which is ideal to set up a Surf and Ice cream shop.

## **Comparing Precipitation for the months of June and December:**

The same dataset also has entries for precipitation for the same time span (2010-2016) and therefore can be considered a reliable estimate for any June and December months in Oahu. The mean precipitation for June (0.136) is lower than December (0.217) and this also correlates with the corresponding temperatures with these months, (75F in June vs 71F in December). The rainfall falls in the moderate range of 0.098-0.3 inches.

## **Summary and Conclusion:**

The months of June and December are closely analyzed to determine if there are obvious weather changes especially in December. Based on the analysis the mean temperatures are not very different between the months of June and December. Both months fall within the moderate rainfall range of 0.098-0.3 inches. Over 90% of the daily temperatures fall above 68F. Based on this analysis, the daily temperature in Oahu is ideal for a surf and ice cream shop.
